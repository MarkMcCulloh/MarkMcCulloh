### Hi There, I'm Mark ðŸ‘‹

**I'm a huge fan of developer enablement, from typing code to operating at scale**

- Previously maintained [winglang](https://github.com/winglang/wing) to democratize the cloud
- Big fan of AWS CDK and all members of the [constructs](https://github.com/aws/constructs) family
- Maintainer of [vscode-projen](https://github.com/MarkMcCulloh/vscode-projen) to support the amazing [projen](https://github.com/projen/projen) project
- Most proficient with TypeScript, Rust, and C#, but I'm an appreciator of all languages
